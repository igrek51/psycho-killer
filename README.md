  - Memory usage, including `Dirty` and `Writeback` memory to keep an eye on ongoing copying
  - CPU usage
  - Disk space usage
  - Disk IO utliziation
  - Network transfer
  - Temperatures
- Group processes by executable path and show aggregated stats, e.g. total memory usage of a multiprocess application
